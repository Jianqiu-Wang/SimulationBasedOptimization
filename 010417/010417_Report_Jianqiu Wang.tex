\section{Study of PySOT}
\subsection{Brief Introduction to PySOT}
PySOT is a tool box designed for solving both continuous and discontinuous surrogated optimization problems.
\subsection{Apply PySOT to Two-node Network}
Based on this paper??, we simply consider a network with one supplier and receiver. We use the case in part 7, only consider node 1 and node 4.
\subsection{Important Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
\item{On-hand inventory} The inventory in stock
\item{On-order inventory} The ordered inventory but not yet shipped
\item{Backorder} Unsatisfied order
\item{Inventory position} Amount of order we \'have\': on-hand + on-order - backorder
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Assumption}
\begin{itemize}
\item A demand-driven inventory system under base-stock policy and order rationing policy
\item General network structure for the inventory system (all the pri- mary supplier, secondary supplier and direct customer node(s) of each node are designated, if any)
instead: one supplier and one director customer node
\item Length of planning horizon: 200 days with 100 days of warm-up simulation
\item Length of review cycle for each inventory
\item Probability distributions of demands at sales regions
node 2: Normal(150,30)
\item Probability distributions of the delivery preparation times
(include but not limited to time for reprocessing, transportation,
sub-packaging, etc.) at each inventory node 
node 1: Uniform(2,4) 
\item Lower bounds for service levels at each node:
node 1: 0.70
node 2: 0.95
\item unit holding cost, unit backordering cost: 1 m.u./unit/day
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Source of Uncertainties}
