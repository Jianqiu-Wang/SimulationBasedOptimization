\paragraph{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Grey-box problem:} A combination of constrains or objective functions with known and unknown functional forms
\item{Why not deterministic global optimization:} high computational cost, unreliable derivative information from noise, discontinuity of obj fcn/constraints, and lack of model equations if only given input-output data (Would it be similar to financial time series data?)
\item{Promising approach:} surrogate approximation models for unknown equations of system.(Through which we may apply derivative-based optimization).
\item{Why global optimization of surrogate model necessarry:} Usually the most efficient surrogate functional forms are multimodal ( with serveral peaks )
\item{How we treated:} Compilatioon of determnistic global optimization subproblems with sampling and design of experiments, parameter estimation and global optimization of surrogate formulations.
\item{3 important questions:} 1. Variability of initial sample points would affect consitensy of grey-box algorithm( Consistency?) 2. Using deterministic global optimization is important, why? 3. Selection of surrogate function?
\end{itemize}
